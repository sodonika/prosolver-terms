    <h1>ProSolver - Terms of Service</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to ProSolver. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of ProSolver’s mobile 
        application and related services ("Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree 
        to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you may not 
        use the Service.

        You agree to use the Service only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. 
        You must not:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the Service in violation of any applicable laws or regulations.</li>

    <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
    <p>
        Some features require creating an account. You must provide accurate information and keep 
        it updated. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account 
        credentials. ProSolver is not liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized 
        use of your account.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Premium Plans & Fair-Use Limits</h2>
    <p>
        ProSolver may offer Premium features through monthly or annual subscription plans. To ensure
        stable performance and fair access for all users, certain Premium features may include 
        fair-use limits (for example, limits on daily or monthly AI problem-solving usage).
    </p>
    <p>
        If you exceed these fair-use limits, access to affected Premium features may be temporarily 
        restricted until the next usage cycle. Subscription validity remains unaffected.
    </p>
