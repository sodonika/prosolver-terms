  <h1>ProSolver — Terms of Service</h1>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to ProSolver. These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of ProSolver’s mobile application
    and related services (the "Service"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
    If you do not agree with any part of these Terms, you must not use the Service.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Use of Service</h2>
  <p>
    ProSolver provides AI-powered problem solving, explanations, and educational assistance. You agree to use the
    Service only for lawful purposes and in accordance with these Terms. You must not:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the Service in violation of any applicable laws or regulations.</li>
    <li>Interfere with or disrupt the experience of other users.</li>
    <li>Impersonate ProSolver, ProSolver staff, or any other person or entity.</li>
    <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer, manipulate, overload, or abuse the Service or AI systems.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
  <p>
    Some features require creating an account. You must provide accurate information and keep it updated.
    You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials. ProSolver is not liable
    for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of your account.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Premium Plans & Fair-Use Limits</h2>
  <p>
    ProSolver may offer Premium features through monthly or annual subscription plans. To ensure stable performance
    and fair access for all users, certain Premium features may include fair-use limits (for example, limits on
    daily or monthly AI problem-solving usage).
  </p>
  <p>
    If you exceed these fair-use limits, access to affected Premium features may be temporarily restricted until
    the next usage cycle. Any such restriction does not cancel or refund your subscription automatically.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
  <p>
    All content, code, features, and functionality within ProSolver are the property of ProSolver and its licensors.
    The Service is protected by international copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. You may not
    copy, modify, reproduce, or distribute any part of the Service without prior written permission.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Your use of the Service is also governed by the ProSolver Privacy Policy. Please review the Privacy Policy to
    understand how we collect, use, and protect user data.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Termination</h2>
  <p>
    We may suspend or terminate access to the Service at our discretion if you violate these Terms or engage in misuse.
    You may discontinue using the Service at any time.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>
    To the fullest extent permitted by law, ProSolver and its officers, directors, employees, agents, suppliers,
    or licensors shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages,
    including loss of profits, data, goodwill, or other intangible losses arising out of your access to or use of
    the Service.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
  <p>
    We may update these Terms from time to time. When changes are material we will provide notice (for example via
    in-app notice or update). Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Governing Law</h2>
  <p>
    These Terms shall be governed by the laws of your country or region of residence. If any provision is held invalid
    by a court, the remaining provisions remain in effect.
